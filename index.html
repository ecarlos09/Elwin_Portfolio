      <p>Welcome!  My name is Elwin and I am a coding enthusiast.  I haven't been doing this for very long so what you are viewing is one of my first attempts at creating a web page!</p>
      <p>There is only so much I can tell you about myself here, but if you want to get to know me better, there is a fun little game that you can play below.  Alternatively, you can click on the image above, which will take you to my linkedIn page.</p>

    <!-- Game instructions -->
    <div id="instructions">
  
      <h2>Two truths and a lie</h2>
  
      <p>The following is a well-known icebreaker.  If you already know the rules, then you can just <a href="#letsPlay">jump to the game!</a></p>
    
      <p>If you've not heard of this game before, the instructions are fairly simple.  After you've entered your name in the form below, three statements will appear.  Two of these are true facts about me, while the other is be a complete lie.  Your task is to figure out which of the three statements is false.</p>
